# Staging Deployment Runbook

A separate Netlify site for sharing this branch (and any future feature branches) with the project manager or other stakeholders without pushing to prod. Uses a single shared backend with a per-tier password mechanism so the staging traffic doesn't eat the prod daily-token quota.

---

## How the password tier works

Two passwords on the server, each optional:

- **`BETA_PASSWORD`** — if set, POSTs to `/api/auth` with this value return a `normal`-tier token. Subject to the daily token cap.
- **`STAGING_PASSWORD`** — if set, POSTs to `/api/auth` with this value return a `staging`-tier token. Bypasses the daily token cap. Usage is still recorded for observability.

The tier is baked into the HMAC-signed token, so a normal-tier user can't tamper their way into staging.

If `STAGING_PASSWORD` is unset (production), the upgrade path simply doesn't exist — the auth route 401s on any password that isn't `BETA_PASSWORD`.

On the client, the **Staging access** pill in the bottom-right corner only renders when the build env `VITE_STAGING_GATE_ENABLED=true`. On prod the pill is absent at compile time.

## One-time setup

### Server (whichever host you deploy the Express app to — Railway / Render / Fly / etc.)

Set these envs on the backend service:

| Env | Value |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | your Anthropic key (same one prod uses) |
| `BETA_PASSWORD` | leave unset unless you want a normal-tier password too |
| `STAGING_PASSWORD` | a strong opaque string — this is the cap-bypass password |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | comma-separated list including BOTH the prod and staging Netlify origins, e.g. `https://blo-livability.netlify.app,https://blo-staging.netlify.app` |
| `PORT` | as required by host |

If you redeploy or add a new staging origin later, append to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and restart the server.

### Frontend — staging Netlify site

1. **Create a second Netlify site** linked to this same Git repo (`nicholasburka/BLO-landmap`).
2. **Production branch:** `ux-redesign-phase4b` (or whichever feature branch you're staging).
3. **Build settings** — already in `netlify.toml`:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. **Environment variables** on the staging site:

   | Env | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_API_URL` | URL of the shared backend, e.g. `https://blo-api.up.railway.app` |
   | `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | same Mapbox token as prod (or a separate one if you want separated usage metrics) |
   | `VITE_STAGING_GATE_ENABLED` | `true` — turns on the "Staging access" pill in the bottom-right |

5. **Deploy** — Netlify builds the branch and assigns a URL like `blo-staging.netlify.app`.

### Frontend — prod Netlify site

Leave it alone. Do NOT set `VITE_STAGING_GATE_ENABLED` on prod — the pill is supposed to be invisible there.

## Sharing access with the PM

Send them:

1. The staging URL (e.g. `https://blo-staging.netlify.app`)
2. The `STAGING_PASSWORD` value
3. A note: "Click the **Staging access** pill in the bottom-right of the map, paste the password, hit Unlock. You'll see a green ✓ Staging tier badge — that means the daily cap is off for your session."

The session lasts 24 hours (token TTL). They re-enter the password to extend.

---

## Local dev

For pure local development you don't need the password gate at all — set `BUDGET_BYPASS=true` in `server/.env` and skip the password mechanism. That env disables the cap globally on the local backend.

If you want to test the staging-gate flow locally:

1. Set `STAGING_PASSWORD=local-test` in `server/.env`.
2. Add `VITE_STAGING_GATE_ENABLED=true` to a local `.env` file in the repo root (or pass on the Vite command line).
3. `npm run dev` and click the **Staging access** pill that appears bottom-right.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Pill doesn't appear** — `VITE_STAGING_GATE_ENABLED=true` must be set on the Netlify staging site's env, AND the site rebuilt after setting it. Vite envs are inlined at build time.
- **"Invalid password"** — `STAGING_PASSWORD` on the backend doesn't match what was typed, or the backend service was deployed without the env set.
- **CORS errors in the browser console** — the staging Netlify origin isn't in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on the backend. Add it and restart.
- **Cap still appears to apply** — verify in browser devtools that the auth token's payload (base64-decode the first segment) ends with `.staging`. If it ends with `.normal` or has no tier suffix, the password didn't take.
- **`bypassEnabled: true` in `/api/health`** — that's the global `BUDGET_BYPASS` flag, not the per-user staging tier. Don't ship that to a production-facing host.

## Tearing it back down

When the PM testing is done and you want the staging site gone:

1. Either pause the Netlify staging site (Settings → Site overview → "Stop builds") or delete it.
2. Remove the staging origin from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on the backend and restart.
3. Optionally remove `STAGING_PASSWORD` from the backend env to close the upgrade path entirely.

Code-side, no cleanup needed — the gate component is a no-op without its build flag, and the server route is a no-op without `STAGING_PASSWORD`.
